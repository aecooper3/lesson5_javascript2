### Project Description:

tax calculator that calculates a user's total income tax and tax bracket based on
their marital status and annual income.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. If/else statements are used when more than one option for execution is available. 
If a condition is true, one action is executed. If a condition is false, another action
is executed. 
2. If/else statements can be nested inside each other, which means that if a condition 
is true, the action that is executed may be another if/else statement.
3. The getElementById() method is a document object method that references elements
on a web page using their id. We used it in this assingment in order to find elements
on the HTML page and overwrite the existing values with empty strings or values in
order to obtain a functional "clear" button for our application.
